##  How it works? ✨
- First using the provided Github authorization token we fetch the repository using `Github` module of python, this is done in <kbd>github_fetch.py<kbd>
- Next we download all the files such as c,c++,java,python,html,css etc from the repository into our  `repo-downlaods` local folder.
  > The file extensions to be selected can be modified via <kbd>utils.py</kbd>
  
  > In case the folder is not empty, the tool automatically clears all the folder content to avoid file-mismatch.
- We connect with the Eden AI which in turn provides us free access to ChatGPT 3.5 turbo via API.
- Then all files are sent to LLM one by one via `requests` module of python with a `prompt`, this is done in <kbd>analyze_codeabase.py</kbd>
  > The prompt can be modified via <kbd>utils.py</kbd>
- All suggestions are stored in `suggestions.txt` file for later use.

## Contribution 🤝
- Any and all contribution are welcome for this project, you can raise issue with headings as:
 1. New Feature Suggestion
 1. Bug Fix
 1. Code quality/efficiency Improvement
 1. Other..
- Features/Functionalities to be added soon:
    - By pass the token-limit (_4096 right now_) to analyze larger code files ;)
    - Improve the UI/UX in terminal
    - Storing the API-Key more securely
      
_(Raise an issue if you can help me achieve above features ^\_^ )_
